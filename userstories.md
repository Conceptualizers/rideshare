- As the event coordinator, I want to send notifications to either drivers or riders (or both) to announce updates before and during the event.  
- As the event coordinator, I want to know if there is enough space for every rider so that I can contact more drivers (with their phone number) to have them sign up for the event.  
- As a event coordinator, I want to make an event so that people can sign up to rideshare
- As a event coordinator, I want to edit / delete events in case I make a mistake
As an event coordinator, I want to make a driver leaderboard so that I can see how much each user has “contributed” and incentivize driving.
