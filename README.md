## Description & Why
C.A.R. is a rideshare management platform for large student organizations as well as non profits that host many events. As college students, not everyone has a car and some people live off campus. Organizing rides to any off-campus event can be a hassle. C.A.R. streamlines the process for everyone involved - drivers, riders, and event coordinators - by creating a centralized system for choosing rides, and managing the available drivers and organization's “fleet” of cars.

Event coordinators will create and manage events on the web app while the mobile app will give drivers and riders mobile-specific features to ensure the smoothest ride as possible.
